"""
Per-account activity caps, warm-up ramp, and human pacing.

The numbers here are set from how LinkedIn actually behaves, not from what
automation vendors advertise. Two findings drive the whole design:

1. **Invitations are capped weekly, not daily — roughly 100/week, and the same
   for Free, Premium and Sales Navigator.** Premium does not buy more
   invitations. An account can sit under any daily cap and still get restricted
   by the end of the week, which is why :class:`ActionCaps` carries ``per_week``
   and why the limiter enforces a rolling seven-day window.

2. **Acceptance rate restricts accounts more reliably than volume does.** Below
   ~15% acceptance LinkedIn treats the account as spam regardless of how modest
   the volume is; a meaningful share of restricted accounts were inside the
   published limits the whole time. So caps here are a ceiling, and
   ``outreach/health.py`` scales them *down* based on measured acceptance.

Consequence for planning: a target like "800 connections/month" (~185/week) is
about double the standard allowance and is only reachable by an aged, high-SSI
account. The AGGRESSIVE tier below exists so that can be chosen deliberately —
but it is never the default, and the acceptance governor will still pull it back
if the audience isn't responding.

Every number is overridable per account (``ConnectedAccount.daily_caps``).
