"""
Preflight: prove a real account works using only read-only calls.

When you tie in a live LinkedIn account for the first time, the riskiest thing
you can do is find out whether the integration works by *sending something*. A
malformed invitation is not recoverable — it went to a real person under the
user's name, and LinkedIn counted it.

So preflight exercises the whole stack — session construction, TLS fingerprint,
device headers, the CSRF token, endpoint shapes, response parsing — using calls
that only ever read:

    whoami          → is the session valid, and who is it?
    fetch_profile   → can we resolve a person and parse the response?
    fetch_inbox     → can we read conversations (needed for reply detection)?
    fetch_activity  → can we see posts (needed for engagement)?

If whoami succeeds, the hard part is proven: headers, cookies and CSRF are all
correct, because Voyager rejects the request outright otherwise. The remaining
checks tell you which *features* will work, and a failure in one of them is a
known gap rather than a surprise later.

Nothing here writes, likes, connects, messages or posts. It is safe to run
against a production account at any time.
