"""
Copy quality gate: the deterministic "is this spam?" check.

Every drafted message passes through here before a human ever sees it, and
again before it is sent. It is rules-based on purpose — a model asked "is this
spammy?" will happily approve its own output, and the failure modes we care
about (a leaked ``{{first_name}}``, a booking link in a connection note, a
message that could have been sent to literally anyone) are precisely the ones
plain string checks catch reliably.

Two severities:

- **Blockers** fail the copy outright. It cannot be shown for approval or sent
  until it is rewritten. These are things that are always wrong.
- **Warnings** deduct from a 0-100 quality score and are surfaced to the
  reviewer. These are things that are usually wrong.

The bar is intentionally high. Copy that scores badly here is copy that would
have made the recipient think "this is a bot", which is the one outcome that
costs more than sending nothing at all.
