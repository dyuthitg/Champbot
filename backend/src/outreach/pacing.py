"""
Human pacing: when an approved action is actually allowed to happen.

Caps answer "how much"; pacing answers "when", and the second question is the
one bot-detection actually watches. Twenty invitations spread naturally across
a Tuesday afternoon is a person. The same twenty fired in ninety seconds at
04:12 is software, regardless of whether it stayed under the daily cap.

Rules applied here:
- Actions only run inside the account's configured active hours.
- Weekends are heavily reduced rather than zero — a schedule that is exactly
  Monday-to-Friday, 9-to-5, every week, is its own kind of signature.
- Every send gets randomized jitter, so intervals never form a pattern.
- Consecutive sends are spaced by at least the action's cooldown.

Randomness is injectable so tests are deterministic.
