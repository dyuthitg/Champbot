"""
Outreach sequences: connect → accepted → follow up → qualify → book.

The rule that matters most in this file is stated once and enforced everywhere:

    **A reply stops the sequence. Immediately, permanently, no exceptions.**

Nothing does more damage to a real conversation than an automated follow-up
landing after someone has already answered. It is the single clearest tell that
a person was talking to software, and it costs the meeting that the whole
sequence existed to book. So ``advance`` refuses to produce a next step for any
target a human now owns, and the sync job that detects replies flips that state
before the scheduler ever runs.

The second rule concerns scheduler links. A booking link in a first touch is
spam — the quality gate blocks it outright. But once someone has replied and
shown interest, sending a link is exactly what they want. The step definitions
below carry ``allow_scheduler_link``, which is only true after a reply, and the
quality gate honours that flag rather than applying one blanket rule.
