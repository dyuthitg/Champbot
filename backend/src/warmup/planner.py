"""
The daily activity planner.

Turns "this account is on day 3 of the react stage" into "today, do 9 likes and
2 follows, spread between 09:12 and 17:40". This is what makes a warming account
look like a person using LinkedIn rather than a process executing a quota.

Three properties matter more than the exact numbers:

- **Variance.** Volumes are sampled from a band, not fixed. An account that
  does exactly 12 likes every day is as detectable as one that does 500.
- **Quiet days.** Optional actions carry a probability below 1.0, so some days
  produce nothing. Real people miss days; schedulers don't.
- **Irregular timing.** Actions are scattered across the active-hours window
  with uneven gaps, never on a fixed interval.

The plan is *deterministic per (account, day)*: the same account asked twice on
the same day gets the same plan, so re-running the planner is safe and the
result is testable. It changes tomorrow because the seed includes the date.
