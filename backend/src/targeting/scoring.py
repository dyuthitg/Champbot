"""
Relevance scoring: is this the right person to talk to?

Deliberately deterministic — no model call. Three reasons:

1. **Explainability.** The user reviewing a suggestion sees exactly why someone
   was surfaced ("title matches 'Head of Growth'; industry matches 'SaaS'").
   A similarity score from an embedding explains nothing.
2. **Auditability.** The same target always scores the same, so a suppression
   or a floor change has predictable consequences.
3. **Cost.** Scoring runs over every candidate; inference runs only over the
   handful that survive.

An LLM still writes the copy (``outreach/copy.py``) and can be layered on top
as a re-ranker later, but it never decides *whether* someone is in scope.

Scoring is out of 100 across the dimensions the ICP actually defines. An ICP
that specifies only titles is scored purely on titles rather than being
penalized for the fields it left blank — otherwise every ICP would need every
field filled in to clear the floor.
