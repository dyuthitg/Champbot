"""
Warm-up runner: advance stages, record activity, report progress.

This is the loop a scheduled job calls once a day per account. It does three
things, in this order, and the order matters:

1. **Assess health.** Measured acceptance rate, plus whether LinkedIn has
   challenged the account.
2. **Move the stage.** Forward if the account has earned it, backward if the
   numbers say it is in trouble. A demotion is not a failure state — it is the
   system doing its job before LinkedIn does it for us.
3. **Plan the day.** Only then produce the activity plan, at the stage and
   throttle that step 2 settled on.

Doing health *before* planning is what stops an account from spending a whole
day executing a plan built on stale assumptions.
